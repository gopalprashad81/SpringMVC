If you want to use an Oracle database, for this exercise the recommendation is to use a local Docker instance.

=== Database

Install Docker (https://www.docker.com/).

Then install this container: https://hub.docker.com/_/oracle-database-enterprise-edition.
Follow instructions on the container page and test your database using Oracle SQL Developer.

Open a terminal
View containers:
----
docker container ls
----
or
----
docker ps
----

You can also install Kitematic to view and manage your containers.

==== Oracle 12c in a docker container. SQL script needed to create the user and schema:

----
CREATE USER prod IDENTIFIED BY prod;
GRANT CONNECT TO prod;
GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE, DBA TO prod;
GRANT CREATE SESSION TO prod;
GRANT UNLIMITED TABLESPACE TO prod;
----
